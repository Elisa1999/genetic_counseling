# genetic_counseling

The main purpose of this project is to evaluate the genetic counseling and germline genetic testing process within the pancreatic adenocarcinoma patient population at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. We are mainly interested in investigating the reasons that patients opt out of genetic testing and genetic counseling and the trend of referral rate after the guideline came out. The report can be divided into five parts. The first part will analyze the reasons in each step why people drop out. We will uncover the relationship between referral rate and other factors including disease stage and ECOG score. The third part will focus on the overall trend of the referral rate for 30 months. The fourth part will compare the referral rate before and after the genetic center offered telehealth and help to answer the question of whether people prefer telehealth to in-person meetings. The last part is the additional analysis of people with second opinions as well as an exploration of the dominant reasons for dropping-out individuals.
